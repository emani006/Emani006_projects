                        You know the obvious behaviors that describe someone who is healthy and takes care of themselves. 
                        In general, a healthy person doesn't smoke, tries to maintain a healthy weight, eats nutritious foods, 
                        and <a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/body-into-fat-burning-machine-1231548">exercises regularly</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The good news is, you don't have to change everything at the same time. In fact, the trick to healthy living 
                        is making small changes—taking more steps each day,1 adding fruit to your cereal, having an extra glass of 
                        water, or saying no to that second helping of buttery mashed potatoes. One thing you can do right now to make 
                        your lifestyle healthier is to move more.

                        <p>
                        Then there are other elements to add to the list. A healthy person also knows how to manage stress, 
                        gets good quality sleep each night, doesn't drink too much, doesn't sit too much—basically, 
                        does everything in moderation all the time. When you look at everything that could possibly go into a healthy 
                        lifestyle, you can see just how hard all of those things are in our current world.

                        You know you need to exercise, but there are many excuses not to do it. You're too busy, 
                        don't know where to start, you're not motivated or you're afraid you'll injure yourself. 
                        Maybe you think exercise has to be really hard or it isn't good enough.    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whatever definition you have about what exercise is or isn't, the bottom line is that 
                        exercise is movement. Whether it's walking around the block or running a marathon, that 
                        movement is exercise and every time you move more than you normally do, it counts.

                            <h2>Sustainable Weight Loss or Weight Maintenance</h2>
                            <img src="Assets/Images/Weight.png" width="45" alt="Weight Loss" align="left"/>

                    <p>
                        Even if you opt for small changes, the benefits are still pretty amazing. For example, 
                        increasing your activity level can help you to reach and maintain a healthy weight. 
                        If you are currently overweight, small steps toward that goal can have an impact.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In fact, you don't even have to have a goal to lose weight, especially if you have trouble 
                        sticking to a program. Why not focus on being healthy to start and not worry about the 
                        weight loss because as you move more, you may find that you start losing some additional 
                        weight too.
